oil algo ideas:
1) level hasn't been broken - with a big volume instant reversal of local trend. false positives - possible level retest with a break.
2) spread between ice and moex brent in instant moment that normalises in flat trend
3) post-clearing rising spread + flat trend
4) trading range(small, big, medium), with false breakouts
5) hitting level, then bouncing back, then trying to pass level below first one and not succeeding - see https://imgur.com/a/mvZh4yu
6) brent options during volatility - straddle & strangle
