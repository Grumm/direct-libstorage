oil algo ideas:
1) level hasn't been broken - with a big volume instant reversal of local trend. false positives - possible level retest with a break.
ex: https://imgur.com/a/UaQIBW1
if after that volumes raising - most likely a false a breakout
https://imgur.com/a/GQEQwoj - double layer - no immediate bounce, but second actually reverts the trend
https://imgur.com/a/oOUs2ZP - small trend up, but global is down

2) spread between ice and moex brent in instant moment that normalises in flat trend
3) post-clearing rising spread + flat trend
4) trading range(small, big, medium), with false breakouts
5) hitting level, then bouncing back, then trying to pass level below first one and not succeeding - see https://imgur.com/a/mvZh4yu
6) brent options during volatility - straddle & strangle
7) on minute candles: when volume increases and price moves after a flat, movement continues(sometimes could be reverse?) - could have something to do with changing delta
8) hitting same price many times within short period of time (+ maybe big volume to a reverse) => bounce back, need to statistically calculate how often it is breakthrough or bounce back
9) after price gap in brent moex, setup orders below curent value to catch stops
10) после первой планки на больших объемах вероятность второй планки или отката
11) детект айсбергов и игра вокруг них - пробой вверх или вниз
12) trend is your friend

The key conclusions from this analysis are:

Scalping is essentially a volatility trade
The setting of optimal profit targets are stop loss limits depend critically on the volatility of the underlying, and needs to be handled dynamically, depending on current levels of market volatility
At low levels of volatility we should set tight profit targets and wide stop loss limits, looking to make a high percentage of small gains, of perhaps 2-3 ticks.
As volatility rises, we need to reverse that position, setting more ambitious profit targets and tight stops, aiming for the occasional big win.
